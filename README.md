Fire-Fighting Kinect Game

A fire-fighting game that uses Vizard virtual reality software and the Microsoft Kinect to allow the player to put out virtual fires using hand gestures. A virtual avatar gives visual feedback by mirroring the player's movements within a 3D environment. The game consists of selecting balls of fire appearing in front of the user to put them out. 


This project uses the Vizard Virtual Reality Software to create the interactive virtual environment and to pair the user with a customized, virtual avatar, Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST) to allow the Microsoft Kinect's skeletal tracking functionality to be used within Vizard, and the Microsoft Kinect for it's motion sensing capabilities.
